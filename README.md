# Chicken Palace

<http://TheCreativeMom.com> for The Home Depot, were the inspiration for the
design of the Chicken Palace.

The original design was modified for better ventilation, both winter and
summer. A removable floor was added for summer along with insulated walls for
all seasons. The nesting box was partitioned for conducive laying space. The
size was reduced to accommodate 2â€“9 full size chickens. The feedbox (piglet
trough) was mounted on the access door to deny snacks to the local rodent
population.

Note the dimensions contain some errors. I haven't corrected the access door,
nor the rough truss alignment, which required modification during the build.
